# CHANGELOG

## 0.0.9

### Changed

* Many strategy (persistence): setter `roles=` does not call save anymore, so it does not persist new records! 

## 0.0.6

### Added

* Added strategies: "One" - the simplest strategy possible and "Many" - the former only strategy from older versions.

### Changed

* SimpleRoles.configure - much better DSL

### Removed

* Removed RolesArray presenter in "Many" strategy

## Prior to 0.0.6 

Long-long history here undocumented...
